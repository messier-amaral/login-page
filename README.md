**I present a simple login screen project that I integrated into my portfolio. It played a crucial role in my learning and practicing of Tailwind CSS, enabling me to finish the site more quickly without wasting time on styling. I hope you like it! Moreover, this project provided an excellent opportunity to practice my programming and website creation skills, incorporating Tailwind CSS media queries to make the site responsive on various devices.** 

**It was also my first time implementing the Mobile First concept in one of my sites.**
